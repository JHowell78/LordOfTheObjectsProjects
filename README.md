### Overview
The Lord of the Objects Project was a peer programming project designed to create
a short story based on character and enemy classes and create a rudimentary combat system
with integer hitPoints for health and String weapons for weapons. The player will be
prompted to choose a class before being pitted against enemies in the game. Once the
player chooses their classes they are ready to start adventuring. During the adventure
the player will stumble upon three doors that they feel compelled to open and once opened
the doors let out enemies that immediately begin attacking the user. If the user is able to
successfully defeat each enemy that comes out of the three doors that are in the forest
they will be victorious. If the player wins or loses the game they are given the option to play
again or exit the game.
